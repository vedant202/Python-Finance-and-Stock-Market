Net generation, however, declined 4.8 percent YoY to 4.3 billion due to a relatively weaker merchant market as coal prices increased by 37 percent YoY to $227 per tonne during the quarter. \n\"Acquisition of Mytrah Energy is expected to be completed in Q4 FY23 (delayed by a quarter), which along with the phase-wise commissioning of SECI IX-810MW and X-450 MW will take the total operational capacity to 9.1GW by FY24.
