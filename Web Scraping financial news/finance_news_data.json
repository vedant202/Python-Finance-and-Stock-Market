Smith is using the threat of job losses to attack Trudeau and rally her conservative base, although she has been criticised for misinterpreting how many jobs may be at risk. \nThe Trudeau government is trying to soothe concerns about the bill, first promised in 2019. A government source familiar with the file, who is not authorized to speak publicly, said the legislation will be about principles to guide decisions and creating jobs. \nTrudeau told Reuters in a recent interview that the sooner Alberta's \"political class\" understood the future is not to be feared, the better.\u00a0 \n\"This shouldn't be a political issue, this is an issue about what's really happening in the global economy,\" said Gil McGowan, President of the Alberta Federation of Labour (AFL). \nCOAL PHASE-OUT LESSONS \nThe focus should be on helping communities adjust to sweeping industrial changes and economic diversification, McGowan said, pointing to Alberta's recent coal phase-out as a case study. \nLater this year, Alberta's last coal-fired power station will convert to natural gas, part of an accelerated energy transition first announced in 2015 that will wrap up seven years ahead of schedule. \nMore than 3,100 people worked in the province's thermal coal industry in 2015. Some workers took early retirement, others went north to the oil patch or moved to other industries, while others found work in mine reclamation or the newly converted gas power stations. \nThe Parkland Institute research centre estimated in 2019 that up to 3,500 new jobs would be created in renewable energy and coal-to-gas power station conversions, but lead author Ian Hussey now says that number was far too low. \n\"Renewable investment has taken off in Alberta in a way that was never even dreamed of when we did that research,\" he said. \nThe oil and gas sector is currently experiencing a skills shortage amid tight labour markets globally, but the current workforce is 18% smaller than the 2014 peak of 225,900, according to Energy Safety Canada. Think tank Clean Energy Canada estimates there could be 200,000 clean energy jobs created by 2030. \nIf done right, the bill could incentivise technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen and be Canada's answer to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the $430-billion green energy subsidy package passed last year, the AFL's McGowan added. \nEx-coal miner Len Austin, who now runs a government-funded Just Transition centre supporting former coal workers, said policymakers made a \"really good effort\" with programs such as retirement bridging, relocation packages and C$12,000 ($8,945.21) retraining vouchers. \nBut there was insufficient funding for economic diversification and infrastructure projects within coal communities to create new jobs, and governments need to understand not everyone can work in renewables, he added. \n\"It's 100% not that simple...to go from making C$100,000 to C$40,000 plays a big part in the decision-making that comes with the idea of losing your livelihood,\" Austin said. \n"}, {"title": "US to cut visa wait times for Indians; to open additional slots on select Saturdays\u00a0", "date": "Jan 23, 2023", "sub para": "<p>Also read:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-refutes-reports-of-1300-employee-count-at-twitter-367073-2023-01-23\" title=\"Elon Musk refutes reports of 1300 employee count at Twitter\">Elon Musk refutes reports of 1300 employee count at Twitter</a></p>", "link": "https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/us-to-cut-visa-wait-times-for-indians-to-open-additional-slots-on-select-saturdays-367075-2023-01-23", "para": "The US embassy in India is aiming to cut visa wait times for applicants with initiatives like special interviews for first-time applicants and greater strength of visa staff across the country.\u00a0 \nAs part of these attempts, the US embassy in Delhi and its consulates in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad conducted special interviews on Saturday, January 21, to accommodate applicants requiring in-person visa interviews.

And for the creation of that hub, you got to take the volatility out of the arrival and departure plans and smoothen out that curve so that you can provide the incoming flights time to allow international departures,\u201d the minister said in response to a query from an industry representative at a civil aviation conference organised by the industry body ASSOCHAM on Wednesday. \nHe said since the exercise could only be accomplished in conjunction with both the airlines and airports, the ministry of civil aviation was doing its bit in turning the ambition into a reality of creating a hub for international and domestic passengers in India by utilising Indian airports and Indian aircraft. \nReferring to the significant growth being witnessed in the world\u2019s third-largest domestic aviation market, the minister said India should be able to touch 400 million airline passengers in the next eight years, while it was just one airport short of doubling its airport capacity to 148 airports from just 74 in FY13-14. He added that given the fleet acquisition plans of Indian carriers, the total number of civilian aircraft in the country would reach anywhere from 1,500-2,000 over the next seven years from the present 700. \n\u201cThat means you have reached capacity. You have reached a potential wherein you need to start sowing the seeds today of creating a hub within India,\u201d the minister urged. \nIt was with this objective that MoCA was actively persuading Indian carriers to launch point-to-point flights on international routes. \n\u201cToday, on domestic routes we are pretty much well settled. But on international routes, it is mostly Sixth Freedom [Right]. You have hubs located outside India. They use India as a transit point and then a long-haul flight takes you to your ultimate destination. It is important for our airlines to also start going from point to point,\u201d the minister said. \nThe Sixth Freedom of the Air allows a carrier the right to transport international traffic moving between two other states via its home state. For instance, Emirates is allowed to ferry passengers from India between India and the UAE to the US via its base in Dubai. \nThe minister praised Air India, Vistara, SpiceJet and other Indian carriers for ordering more wide-bodied aircraft as that would enable them to undertake flights above eight hours. He said that to help Indian carriers meet their short-term requirements, MoCA had allowed them to wet lease aircraft for an extended period of up to one year from the previous six months. \nUnder a wet lease agreement, the aircraft owner supplies the aircraft and one crew member and also takes care of maintenance, insurance and attendant legal responsibilities of operation. \u00a0 \nThe minister said that once the international hub was in place, it would be important to not only connect it with other international airports but also Tier-II and Tier-III airports within the country for enhanced connectivity. \nIf the minister\u2019s plan comes to fruition, the country would not only offer an alternative to rival international aviation hubs such as Dubai and Singapore in Asia-Pacific but also make international fares from India more competitive. \n"}, {"title": "eRupee cannot be converted into cash for now: Report", "date": "Jan 19, 2023", "sub para": "<p><em><strong>Also read:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/digital-rupee-pilot-today-features-where-and-how-it-will-be-rolled-out-all-you-need-to-know-354856-2022-12-01\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Rupee pilot today: Features, where and how it will be rolled out; all you need to know</a></strong></em></p>", "link": "https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/erupee-cannot-be-converted-into-cash-for-now-report-361089-2023-01-19", "para": "The central bank digital currency (CBDC) or the eRupee cannot be, currently, converted into cash and vice versa. eRupee will be issued against bank deposits only by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
